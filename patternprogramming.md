INTRODUCTION TO PATTERN PROGRAMMING:
Pattern programming is a technique used in computer programming to create designs or shapes by printing a series of characters or symbols in a specific sequence. These patterns can be used for various purposes, such as decorative designs, user interfaces, and data visualization. Pattern programming can be implemented in any programming language, and it requires knowledge of basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and variables. The process involves identifying the pattern to be created, defining the sequence of characters or symbols, and using loops or conditional statements to print the pattern repeatedly. Pattern programming can be used in various fields, such as web development, software development, and game development, to create visually appealing and functional designs.
